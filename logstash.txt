Logstash:
—————-

Node Name: To be set.
logstash.yml > node.name: <hostname>

Persistent Queues: To handle high ingest rate and at-least-once delivery
logstash.yml > [ settings TODO]
queue.type :persisted
queue.max_bytes: 3gb

Load Balancing with HAProxy:
TODO
Sample configuration of Haproxy:

listen hanode-1 1.1.1.1:7000
    mode tcp
    balance least conn
    server logstash-node1 2.2.2.2:7000 check
    server logstash-node2 3.3.3.3:7000 check

Keepalived to be used to avoid Single Point Of Failure with HAProxy

Reading from Kafka [Input plugin]:
Run multiple Logstash instances with the same group_id to spread the load across instances.
Num of threads to be equal to the number of partitions
